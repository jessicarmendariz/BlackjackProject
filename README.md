# Blackjack

### Overview
Viva Las Vegas! Gambling is a fun way to win - or lose - money for a lot of people. Blackjack is a common gambling card game in which players try to reach the magic number of 21 without going over. In "Brotherly Love Blackjack" Blackjack is simulated as a single player against a single dealer.

### How To Use
A Player takes a seat at the Eclipse Table and runs the Application. The Player will be told one dealer card, and their two cards. The Player is responsible for some quick math and has to decide whether to hit - add another card - or stay - keep what they have. If they Player has 17 or higher, they have to stay. Once the Player makes their selection, the game reveals what the Dealer's hand is and determines if the Player wins or loses. The Player is then given the option to play again.

### Building Blackjack
I started building Blackjack off of the UML that the instructors reviewed with us. I built small classes piece by piece. I was confident with a lot of the content used to create this application and did not have to reference too much example code from class. 

Problem: Trying to figure out which class should extend and what it should extend.

Solution: I went back and forth on the framework of this but ultimately decided to use BlackjackHand.java to extend the class Hand.java. 

Problem: A big struggle I can sometimes have is remembering EXACTLY what I called a class or method. If I use a nickname or a shortened version of the word, I can sometimes forget that I shortened it and then the code won't connect in the different classes. I also add spaces to some items when I shouldn't and get caught up in typing the code like real words in English instead of real values in Java.

Solution: I like to have a second set of eyes review my code, almost like a proof reader.
